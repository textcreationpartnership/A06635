            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is not my profeſſion, I muſt confeſſe, to returne challenges or publiſh works of this nature; yet knowing that <hi>Truth is iuſtified of her children;</hi> I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, as a child of that Mother, to vindicat her

            <p>It is an vndoubted truth &amp; ſubſcribed by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the faith which Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught in the firſt age had viſible profeſſors in al ages. It were therefore ſufficient (without any further recital of

to frame a counterchallenge by demanding, <hi>By what authoritie of Scriptures, &amp; ancient Fathers they haue impoſed new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtian beliefe vpon Prieſts &amp; people?</hi> ſure I am, thoſe twelue new coined Articles declared by their gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Councel of Trent and publiſhed by Pope <hi>Pius the fourth,</hi> are ſo far ſhort from the knowledge of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, that as yet they are ſcarce vnderſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their own Diſciples for Articles of Faith.

            <p>It is no wonder, that a blind obedience and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith is ſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded to the ignorant of the Romane Church, when their best learned Doctors are forced to confeſſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the chiefe Articles (wherein they differ from vs) that they can neither ſubſiſt by Antiquitie, nor ſtand with the ſafety of the beleeuer: Neither may it ſeeme ſtrange that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould create new Articles of faith, when as they dare alter and detract from the

as taught and profeſſed the <hi>39.</hi> Articles of Religion of our Church, in all ages, let them in euery age produce one Ancient and orthodox Father, who did teach and maintaine their twelue new Articles <hi>de Fide</hi> (which they command vnder a curſe to be beleeued of all men) I ſay let them produce but one in euery age, or but anyone in all the ages for <hi>1500.</hi> yeares after Chriſt, till the dayes of <hi>Luther,</hi> that taught and beleeued all their twelue new Articles <hi>de Fide</hi> as points of faith, and for that one <hi>good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9493:8"/>
ſake, I will be ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as to acknowledge their profeſſors viſible in al ages; I will ſay their Biſhops, and Cardinals, and Schoolemen, which haue witneſſed the Antiquitie of our doctrine, were miſtaken, and ought to bee reformed by an <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> I will te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are guiltie of Noueltie, and ſubmit my obedience with an implicit faith to the Romane Church.</p>
            <p>And, as touching my owne particular, I profeſſe, through the prouocation of a Ieſuite, I haue vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>It is reported of <hi>Redwald</hi> king of the Eaſt Saxons,<note place="margin">Camdens Britannia Eng. pa. <hi>465.</hi>
                  </note> that he was the firſt of all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was baptized and receiued Chriſtianitie: but afterward being ſeduced by his wife: hee had in the ſelfe ſame Church (ſaith <hi>Bede</hi>) one Altar for Chriſts Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and another for ſacrifices vnto diuels. Such was the ſtate of the Romane Church eſpecially in the ages after the diuell was let looſe: there were ſome that did conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate themſelues and their ſeruice to the right worſhip of God alone: others to the adorations of Saints and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; there were ſome that did conſtantly adore the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in his bodily preſence in heauen: whilſt others in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9493:22"/>
ſame Church did ignorantly worſhip the Creature in a conſecrated hoſt vpon the Altar: and thereupon <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Cecaenas</hi> Generall of the order of Franciſcans, about 400. yeares paſt, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the different opinions of different members in the ſame Church, complained: <hi>There were two Churches,</hi>

                  <hi>the one of the wicked ſort flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in which the Pope raigned: the other of godly &amp; good men, and this Church he perſecuted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This learned Friar by his diſcouerie of two Churches, ſhewes that long ſince there was a difference in Religion betwixt the two Siſters, and thereby he plainly intimates the different eſtate betwixt Papiſt and Proteſtant in the ſame Church; the maior part

was ſubiect to the Pope, and that flouriſhed and was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the eyes of the world: but, ſaith the <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> that part conſiſted of the wicked, and conſequently was the malignant Church: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part was obſcured and perſecuted by the Pope, but (ſaith he) it conſiſted of the faithfull and true beleeuers, and conſequently was the true Church.</p>
               <p>I could aſcend yet higher, and ſhew that the falling out of the two Siſters was about a husband; the one was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to her firſt loue Chriſt Ieſus the ſole head of her Church; the other ſought a diuorce from her husband, acknowledging the Pope to be the vniuerſall head of all Churches: but I leaue this to

                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:9493:83"/>
Beſides how can the ſaith of Chriſtians depend vpon a Church which is fallen from the faith? or how can a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beleefe of Chriſtianitie relye ſafely vpon a Councel, that is diſclaimed by the greateſt part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, viz. by England, by France, by Germanie? &amp;c. But to let paſſe the Helue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, the Scottiſh, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and the Engliſh Churches, what will become of the ancient Church of Rome, nay what will become of their owne Schoolemen in the latter ages? did they all beleeue and teach that there were neither more nor leſſe then ſeuen Sacraments? did they maintaine they were all inſtituted by Chriſt? did they profeſſe they were all truly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9493:83"/>
and properly Sacraments of the new Law? If any learned man, or if all the learned men aliue, ſhall prooue that the ſeuen Trent Sacraments were inſtituted by Chriſt, &amp; that all the Fathers, or any one Father in the Primitiue Church, or any knowne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor for aboue a thouſand yeares after Chriſt, did teach that there were neither more nor leſſe then ſeuen, truely and properly ſo called, and to be beleeued of all for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith, (all which is the conſtant doctrine of the Church of Rome) let the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema</hi> fall vpon my head.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is agreed on both ſides that the Sacraments of the new Law were inſtituted by Chriſt (for he onely hath authoritie to ſeale the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9493:84"/>
in whoſe authority onely it is to grant it.) Now as Princes ſeales confirme and warrant their deeds and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo doe the Sacraments witneſſe vnto our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Gods promiſes are true, and ſhall continue for euer; Thus doth God make knowne his ſecret purpoſe to his Church: firſt he declareth his mercies by his word, then he ſealeth it, and aſſureth it by his Sacraments: <hi>In the word we heare his promiſes, in the Sacraments wee ſee them,</hi> The difference then betwixt the Church of Rome and vs ſtands in this; In the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, wee haue the element and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; in the other fiue there wanteth either of theſe,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9493:84"/>
and therefore in a right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are not be taken for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: In Baptiſme the element is water, in the Lords Supper bread &amp; wine: Baptiſme hath the words of Inſtitution,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note>

               <p>Farre be it from the thoughts of good men, to thinke <hi>the points in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie betwixt them and vs, are of an inferior alloy, that a man may reſolue this way or that way, without perill of hu ſaluation:</hi> The freſh blee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding wounds and ſufferings of holy men &amp; bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in our church, doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie witnes the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in their Religion and the

               <head>Sect. <hi>18.</hi> Prouing (according to the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the booke) by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of all ſides, that the Proteſtants Religion is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, becauſe in all poſitiue points of our doctrine, the Romaniſts themſelues agree with vs, but in their additions they ſtand ſingle by themſelues.</head>
               <p>BVt admit the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſhould allow a poſſibility of ſaluation, to all beleeuing Chriſtians in the boſome of the Roman Church (which neuer yet was granted) what doe our aduerſaries inferre from hence? Therefore (ſay they) <hi>It is the ſafer way to perſiſt in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:9493:175"/>
that Church where both ſides agree, then where one part ſtands ſingle in opinion by themſelues.</hi> Now ſurely, if that be the ſafer way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in differing parties agree both in one; I will ioyne iſſue with them in this very point, and if in this I make not good (the Title of my book) that wee are therefore in the ſafer way, becauſe they agree in the principall points of Controuerſie with our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I will reconcile my ſelfe to the Romane Church, and creepe of all foure to his Holineſſe for a pardon.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, we ſay there is a Heauen and a Hell; It is true ſay they, but there is a Purgatory, there is a Limbus Infantum alſo; In the firſt part they ioyne with vs, in
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:9493:175"/>
the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>We ſay we ſhall be ſaued by the Merits and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt Ieſus: It is true ſay they, but there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe merits of Saints, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of our owne help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In the firſt part they ioyne with vs, in the latter they ſtand ſingle by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>Wee ſay the Sacrament of Baptiſme and the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, are two proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtituted by Chriſt: it is true ſay they, but there are fiue more to bee receiued as true and proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>de fide</hi> for an Article
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:9493:176"/>
of beleefe: The firſt two they confeſſe with vs, in the latter fiue they ſtand ſingle by themſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>Wee ſay that Images of Chriſt and his Saints are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and memorials of the abſent, and may in ſome Caſes ſerue for Hiſtorie; It is true ſay they, but there is alſo worſhip and veneration due vnto them: In the firſt part they agree with vs, in the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues, And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>We ſay with the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt: <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue;</hi> It is true ſay they, but there bee Saints
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:9493:176"/>
and Angels alſo that muſt be inuocated and adored: In the firſt part they ioyne with vs, in the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>We ſay that Chriſt is the Mediator and Interceſſour betwixt God and Man: It is true ſay they, but the Saints and Angels are our Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and Mediators alſo: In the firſt part they ioyne with vs, in the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues, &amp; that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>We ſay that Chriſt is the Head and Monarch of the Church, it is true ſay they, but there is likewiſe another viſible Head of the Church which is the Pope: In the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:9493:177"/>
firſt part they ioyne with vs, in the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>We ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> had a Primacie of order, that is, a Firſt-ſhip among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: It is true ſay they, but withall he had a ſupremacie of power and Iuriſdiction: In the firſt place they ioyne with vs, in the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>We ſay there are 22. books of Canonicall Scripture, It is true ſay they, but there are other bookes alſo, as namely <hi>To bit, Iudith,</hi> the <hi>Machabees, &amp;c.</hi> that are Canonicall, In the firſt part they approue all that we hold, in the latter
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:9493:177"/>
they ſtand ſingle by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>Wee ſay the Scripture is the Rule of faith, It is true ſay they, but there are Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions likewiſe, and vnwritten verities that muſt bee added to the Scriptures: In the firſt they ioyne with vs, in the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues: And that is the ſafer way where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we ſay there are 12. Articles of the Creed, and this is the Tenet and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: It is true ſay they, but their are 12. Articles more publiſhed by <hi>Pope Pius the Fourth,</hi> to be receiued of all men: In the firſt place they confeſſe all that we hold, in

the latter they ſtand ſingle by themſelues: And that is the ſafer way by our aduerſaries confeſſion where both ſides agree.</p>
               <p>Thus by the ample teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the beſt learned in the Romane Church, there is nothing taught by the Proteſtants, <hi>de fide,</hi> for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, which the Church of God hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies held neceſſarie to bee beleeued, nothing but that which alone is ſufficient for euerie Chriſtian man to know concerning his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing but that which is confeſſed by our aduerſaries to bee ſafe and profitable for all beleeuers, nothing but that wherewith the writings of all antiquitie are conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and all Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
